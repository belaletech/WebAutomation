## Selenium Login Script

### Description

This code is a Python script that demonstrates the use of Selenium WebDriver to automate the login process on a website. It opens Google, performs a search, and clicks on a specific link. Then, it enters login credentials on the target page and submits the form.

### Dependencies

- Selenium: The code requires the Selenium library to be installed. You can install it using the following command:

```
pip install selenium
```

- Chrome WebDriver: The script uses the Chrome WebDriver to automate interactions with the Chrome browser. The Chrome WebDriver Manager is used to automatically download and install the appropriate WebDriver. You can install the Chrome WebDriver Manager using the following command:

```
pip install webdriver_manager
```

### Usage

1. Make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies as mentioned above.

2. Update the code with the appropriate URLs and login credentials for your target website.

3. Run the script using the following command:

```
python script.py
```

### Note

- The script uses time.sleep() to introduce delays between actions. You may need to adjust the sleep durations based on the performance of the target website.

- The script maximizes the browser window using `driver.maximize_window()`. If you don't want the window to be maximized, you can remove or comment out this line.

- After the script completes, it is important to call `driver.quit()` to close the browser and release system resources.
